## To declare a variable we use VAR=DATA
            ## EX: a=10,b=red
## In shell by default their is no data types.
## a=10,10 is not a number for interpretor, it is just a string.
## for the beginers it is easy to learn shell, no need to declare the data types.
## a=true, not a boolian, it is a string
## a=abc, not a character, but it is string.

## when your data having some special characters then provide input in quotes.. Double is preferred

a=10
echo a = $a
b=30
echo b = $b
